To start making a game or application in Unity, you will need to create a project. As you work you will add to your project all of the assets that you need for your game or applicaiton.

Scenes are assets within a project. When you create a new project it opens a 'SampleScene' for you to work with. Scenes are where you develop your content.

Small projects may have one single scene but larger projects might have one scene per level or minigame.

You can create new empty scenes from the File menu or duplicate scenes, if you want to expand on existing content, by clicking on them in the Project window and pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>).

To open a scene for editing, double-click on it in the Project window. To save an open scene, right-click on it in the Hierarchy window and select **Save Scene**.
